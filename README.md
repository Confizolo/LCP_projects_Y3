# Final Projects for Laboratory of Computational Physics

In each of the branches of this repo you find all the necessary to complete your final project.

In the master branch you'll find a csv file ("groups.csv") containing the matching students-groups. A code snippet to browse the file is provided too. 

Each other branch is named after the group of students a given project is assigned to. The name is left generic, "GroupN", on purpose, the actual group members are listed in the Members.txt file.

Students are supposed to work together to produce a short report on the assigned task, which will have to be committed to the group branch together with the code developed to achieve the results. The preferred format for the latter is a jupyter notebook, with the proper description, the code implemented for the purpose and the actual results (plots, tables, etc.). Alternatively, description and results could be provided in a paper-like document, whereas the code still in a jupyter notebook.

Further information about the deliverables are given in the project instructions.

The following files are there for reference:

*  Members.txt the list of students belonging to the group

*  Project.ipynb the actual description of the assigned project

Other files could be present if needed.


### Computing Resources 

A Virtual Machine within [CloudVeneto](http://cloudveneto.it/) can be created for each group. Note that, by default, they are not. For some projects though, large datasets are needed, in those cases a VM has been created to store those files. Refer to ClouldInstructions.md for the steps to take in order to use those resources.

### Dates for the exams

The date of the final exam could be booked on [doodle](https://doodle.com/poll/rnfn86dk6m647g6a) by selecting the periods (the dates are just placeholders for the first or the second half of a given month)
